## Assignment 1: Errors

- Knitting to pdf, seem mostly solved (should be)
- R Chunks, in particular `eval=FALSE` and `eval=TRUE`
    - `eval=FALSE` is useful to include code in output without running it
    - Especially useful when you want to include code that produces errors
- `library(ggplot2)`, but you use `ggplot(...)`

## Assignment 1: Comments on Errors

Include your comments by quoting them on Discourse: 

- See my post on Discourse on adding error messages.

Don't include `install.packages(...)` in .Rmd files:

- It suggests you have to install it every time you knit.

## Warning: The following objects are masked


```
The following objects are masked from ‘package:stats’:

    filter, lag
```

Example.

## Attendance Check

You should sign the signup sheet. I nonetheless appreciate it if you could also check your attendance via 'youhere.org' -- although it is not mandatory.

- It will help me see how well it works, both for other classes and for research

## Participation: Team Assignment on state of the class

Team assignments as part of participation: 3 to 4 people. 

- 1 to 2 pages (RMarkdown, with html and pdf)
- Goal 1: How is *learning* in general going
    - Such as 'it is too hard' and 'I am learning nothing new' or other
- Goal 2: Identify one topic (a command, an exercise, a data analysis, ...) from class
    - deal with issues others had
- Get data from your classmates (survey, poll, by hand,...) to choose topic and identify learning
    - Nothing huge, but at least one vector with one data point per student (like `languages_heard_of` in lecture 1)

## Team Assignment on state of the class: Example

For this week for instance, possible topic would have been:

- Get knitting to work, quick write up on how to do it
  - Use pre-existing links and descriptions
  - Make sure to cover different OSes, highlight main errors

My guess (without data):

- Mostly everyone getting set up, not yet gotten into much learning
  - But could identify if everyone 'gets' chunks, mark down, etc

## Today and next week

Today: 

- Continue and finish basic visualization

Next week:

- Data munging with hotels data

## Questions?

Any questions?
