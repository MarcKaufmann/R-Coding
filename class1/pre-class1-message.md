Dear all,

for our first class on Monday September 16th, you should do the following to be prepared:

Discourse Forum

In order to participate in the class, you will be required to participate in the (private) forum for this class. I prefer Discourse over Moodle, thus I'll ask you to sign up for an account with a discourse forum for this class:

1. Go to https://discourse.trichotomy.xyz and sign up for an account.
2. You will have to wait until I approve your account.
3. Go through the interactive tutorial with Discobot (in the top right corner you should see that you have a message from Discobot)
4. Reply to First Use of Discourse to introduce yourself briefly.

If you don't seem to receive confirmation emails (or other emails), make sure to check your spam folders, both for CEU and your private accounts, depending on which email you provided and how you forward emails.

GitHub Account and Repository

1. Go to the github repository for this class: https://github.com/MarcKaufmann/R-Coding
2. Complete all the steps in Lecture 0: Technical Prerequisites before Class 1

Syllabus and where to get updates

I will update the syllabus mildly by the first class and include it on the GitHub repository. The Github repository will constitute the valid and updated version of the syllabus -- not Moodle (or elsewhere).

If you have any questions

While I encourage the use of the Discourse Forum to ask questions of a technical nature (other issues are fine by email) since others may benefit from them, you can email me if you hit a problem with the setup (kaufmannm@ceu.edu) if you are unsure or unable to use Discourse. Please let me know if and when you find ambiguities that you are unsure about.

See you all on Monday.

Best,
Marc
