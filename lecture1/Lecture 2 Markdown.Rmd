## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(socviz)

```

```{r}
my_numbers <- c(1,2,3,1,3,5,25)
mean(x=my_numbers)
my_summary = summary(my_numbers)
```
```{r}
table(my_numbers)
```
```{r}
my_new_vector <- c(my_numbers, "Apple")
my_new_vector
class(my_new_vector)
```
```{r}
titanic
titanic
class(titanic)
```

```{r}
titanic_tb <- as_tibble(titanic)
```
```{r}
str(my_summary)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg, aes(x = displ, y= hwy)) +
  geom_point()
```
```{r}
url <- "https://cdn.rawgit.com/kjhealy/viz-organdata/master/organdonation.csv"
organs <- read_csv(file = url)
spec(organs)
```

```{r}
library (gapminder)
gapminder
```
```{r}
p <- ggplot (data = gapminder,
             mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp))
p + geom_point()
```
