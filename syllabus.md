# Syllabus

## Coding 1: Data Management and Analysis with R

- Instructor: Kaufmann Marc; Office: 402, Nador 13; Email: KaufmannM@ceu.edu
- Credits: 2 CEU (4 ECTS) 
- Term: Fall 2019-2020
- Course level:  MA/MSc
- Prerequisites: None
- Course drop: Course can be dropped free of charge 24 hours after the first session. After this date drop is possible until the course is halfway over (late drop fee applies). No changes are allowed past that date.

## Course description

The course serves as an introduction to the R programming language and software environment for data exploration, data munging, data analysis, and data visualization. As such it complements Data Analysis 1 and 2 which focus on the statistical methods, while this class focuses on how to program these methods in R.

### Learning outcomes

- Produce meaningful descriptive statistics and informative graphs
- Become familiar with the R ecosystem 
- Learn how to get help, how to debug, how to learn programming
- Learn how to use R for the most common data tasks: loading, cleaning, transforming, summarizing, and visualizing data

### Assessment (including minimum pass requirement and grading)

- Participation (30%): helping yourself and helping others. This will be based on your contribution to the online class forum, as well as your team's team work. This can include getting help from classmates, or searching online forums and email lists. Part of the weekly assignment will be to document your use of any of these resources.
- Assignments (77-78%): You will have weekly assignments, primarily consisting in completing R Markdown notebooks, and assessing those of your peers. Grading increases over time, with 1% for week one, increasing to 12% by the final week. 

This sums to 107-108%, so you can lose 8% without it affecting your grade at all. There will be no final exam. 

Minimum passing grade is 51%. Every increase in 7% leads to a higher grade: 51 to 57 yields a C; 58 to 64 yields a C+; 65 to 71 yields a B-; 72 to 78 yields a B; 79 to 85 yields a B+, 86 to 92 yields an A-; 93 to 100 yields an A.

**Assignments:** Since there are weekly assignments, I will not be able to grade them all. Instead, you will grade each others assignments. Thus, in week 2, you will grade two assignments of others from week 3, as well as your own. I will provide you with a rubric to do so. A third of your grade from assignments comes from grading others – two thirds of it come from the grade on your actual assignment. 

If you have a question regarding a particular assignment -- whether about the grade or otherwise -- make sure to email me.

Grading the assignments of others serves several purposes:

- There are too many assignments for me to grade
- It is important that there are many assignments, so that you can get practice coding
- By grading other people’s assignments, you will see different ways of solving things
- By grading other people’s assignments, you will see how annoying some kinds of inconsistencies are when they are done by other people (and thus hopefully understand why these inconsistencies are annoying to others trying to read and understand your code)
- Get in the habit of giving and receiving constructive feedback

### Technical/laptop requirement

You will need your laptop with RStudio and R installed in order to participate in class.

### Course schedule 

**Note:** This is subject to substantial reording in the first 3 weeks, to allow both being in synch with other class (Data 1), as well as having a reasonably coherent flow. The set of topics will remain fairly stable.

1. R ecosystem, basic syntax, R Markdown; how to get help; first plot
1. ggplot2: data visualization
1. Tidyverse: choosing data with `filter()`, `select()`, `arrange()`
1. Tidyverse: transforming data with `mutate()`, `summarise()`, `group_by()`
1. Tidyverse: more transformations with `group_by()`, `mutate()`, and `filter()`
1. Tidyverse: reading data with `read_csv()` and `parse_*()`
1. Tidyverse: tidying data with `spread()` and `gather()`; basic hypotheses testing
1. Tidyverse: `left_join()` and `join()`; basic regressions
1. Functions, loops, and friends; sampling, simulating, bootstrapping (GD)
1. working with data the non-tidyverse way; lubridate for working with dates
1. Basic Spatial Data
1. All the rest

### Short bio of the instructor (1 para)

Marc Kaufmann teaches how to think with economic models, and how to use them to ask the right questions. He studied at Cambridge, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Berkeley, and Harvard. He studies the perceptions and beliefs people hold, how this affects their decisions and specifically their productivity.
